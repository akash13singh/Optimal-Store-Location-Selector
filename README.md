#Code to select the optimal store location given delivery locations in a grid
Sample input/output is given in file sample.in 
To run: java <java_file_name> < sample.in

#Input
On the first line, there is a number, 1≤n≤201≤n≤20, indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line with two integers, 1≤x≤1001≤x≤100, 1≤y≤1001≤y≤100, indicating the size of the two-dimensional street grid. Then follow yy lines, each with xx integers, 0≤d≤10000≤d≤1000, indicating the number of deliveries made to each street crossing last year.
