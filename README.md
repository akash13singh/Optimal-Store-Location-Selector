#Code to select the optimal store location given delivery locations in a grid
Sample input/output is given in file sample.in 
To run: java <java_file_name> < sample.in

#Input
On the first line, there is a number, 1≤n≤20, indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line with two integers, 1≤x≤1001, 1≤y≤100, indicating the size of the two-dimensional street grid. Then follow yy lines, each with xx integers, 0≤d≤10000≤d≤1000, indicating the number of deliveries made to each street crossing last year.

#Output
For each test case, output the least possible total delivery cost (the sum of all delivery costs last year), assuming that the kitchen was located optimally. There should be one line for each test case, with an integer indicating the cost, followed by a single space and the word “blocks”.
